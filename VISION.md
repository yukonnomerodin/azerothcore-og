# WoW LK Custom Server — Vision

## One-liner
A custom Wrath of the Lich King server built on AzerothCore with permanent gameplay systems,
seasonal updates, and a strong focus on solo and small-group play.

## What we are building
We are building a long-term World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King server based on AzerothCore.
The project evolves through seasonal patches while maintaining a stable core and a clear identity.

The server is designed to be playable and enjoyable regardless of population size.

## Core principles (non-negotiables)
- **Modular development**: no AzerothCore core modifications; all features are implemented as modules.
- **Stability and performance first**: server health is always prioritized over feature count.
- **Seasonal patch model**: structured patches with clear scope and history.
- **Permanent gameplay systems**: core mechanics (e.g. Mercenaries) are always available.
- **Separation of concerns**:
  - Mercenaries are a gameplay mechanic.
  - Population bots are infrastructure and live in a separate module.
- **Player-driven evolution**: feedback and metrics guide future patches.

## Target experience
- Players can progress solo or in small groups at any time.
- Mercenaries feel like a natural part of the world, not a temporary workaround.
- The world remains alive through optional population bots, without forcing mechanics.
- Each season adds meaningful systems or content without breaking the foundation.

## Success looks like
- A stable server that scales predictably.
- Clear system identity recognizable by players.
- Long-term progression without design contradictions.
- Clean modular codebase that survives years of updates.
