# WoW LK Custom Server — Product Pillars

## 1) Modular Development (No Core Mods)
All gameplay features must be implemented as modules.
Core modifications are forbidden unless explicitly approved.

## 2) Stability & Performance First
No feature is allowed to:
- introduce lag spikes
- block movement or combat
- destabilize world updates

Performance budgets are mandatory.

## 3) Permanent Systems Over Temporary Fixes
Gameplay systems are designed to exist long-term.
Temporary solutions tied to population or events are avoided.

## 4) Seasonal Evolution
The server evolves through structured patches.
Each patch has a clear goal, scope, and rollback plan.

## 5) Separation of AI Roles
- **Mercenaries**:
  - Permanent gameplay mechanic
  - Player-bound companions
  - Always available
- **Population Bots**:
  - Infrastructure module
  - Used to populate the world
  - Can scale independently or be disabled

These two systems must never be coupled.

## 6) Data + Feedback Driven Decisions
Player feedback is important but validated with metrics.
Design decisions must be explainable and measurable.
